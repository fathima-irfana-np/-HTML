After spending some relaxing time on the beach, we had to return to our hotel since the sun was already down. We had our dinner at the hotel and went for some therapeutic treatments after that. My children were extremely contended and happy and slept like dead logs. Even I had a good sleep but woke up early in the morning.

I am a great lover of historical places and keep reading such books and articles despite being a lawyer by profession. Our next destination was decided keeping my choice in mind. We had our breakfast at the hotel and hired a private cab which would take us to the remaining destinations.

Our next destination was Kottakkunnu which is located close to the office of the district collectorate of Malappuram. The driver informed me that Kottakunnu has been developed as a place of tourist attraction only a few years back. The name of the place comes from its main attraction which is a very old fort. The fort is said to be built by Kozhikodeâ€™s zamorins. The term Kottakunnu stands for fort and hill in Malayalam. The traces of the fort can still be seen in this place and that was enough to make my day memorable.
